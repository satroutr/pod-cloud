# This YAML file describes an OpenStack deployment to a known
# datacenter configuration.
#

# ----------------------------------
# Hardware Configuration
# ----------------------------------

# maas-server is a fresh installed Ubuntu 14.04 system in the
# datacenter with ssh access which will be installed to act as the
# MAAS server and PXE/DHCP server. The --install-maas option will
# install MAAS on this ubuntu server allowing this server to act as
# a management node for commissioning and deploying clouds on the
# remaining ipmi-machines or machines managed by the ucs-manager.
maas-server:

    # IP Address to be used on the "PXE" network for MAAS. If the
    # pxe-interface is already bridged, whatever IP address is used
    # there should match.  If pxe-interface is not bridged yet, the
    # created bridge will have this IP address.
    ipaddress: 10.20.0.1

    # Interface name (`ip link`) connected to the PXE network that
    # MAAS should take ownership of.  In addition to PXE, the
    # installer assumes that this network will house Openstack
    # Data/API/Management and provide public internet access.
    # 
    # You can specify a raw interface name or a pre-created bridge.
    # If an interface is specified and is already part of a bridge,
    # the bridge it is a part of will be assumed, otherwise the
    # interface will be bridged for you.  If a bridge is specfied
    # here, it will be used as is with no modification.
    pxe-interface: eth0

    # User on the system that you can reach via ssh public/private
    # key login (passwordless).  Must have passwordless sudo rights.
    username: cisco
       
    # Desired MAAS admin email, user and password.
    maas-admin-email: admin@example.com
    maas-admin-username: admin
    maas-admin-password: Sdu12345

    # Domain name for this pod.  This should be a new domain, not
    # something that already exists in your lab.  MAAS will "own"
    # this domain, and consider itself as the DNS authority for it.
    domain-name: cloud.com

    # Ntp server setting in MAAS
    ntp-server:

    # The following optional proxy variables can be set if the machines to not
    # have direct internet access
    # Proxy url used for https traffic
    #https-proxy:

    # Proxy url used for http traffic
    #http-proxy: "http://myinternalproxy.com"

    # A list of ipaddresses or domain extensions proxy should not be
    # used for. The maas server itself will automatically be added
    # to this list for you.
    #no-proxy: 
    #    - .cisco.com 
    #    - 192.168.4.1
    
    # The location of ubuntu boot images for maas to import.
    # Can be a local mirror of these files to limit network downloads.
    boot-source-url: "http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/"
    # if set to "true", maas will try to refresh the images every hour
    boot-images-auto-import: "false"



# ----------------------------------
# IPMI Machines
# ----------------------------------

# If appropriate to the deployment, list details of each machine not
# managed by a UCSM in order to register these machines in MAAS for
# use in cloud deployments.  This applies to Generic PODs.

# Each machine definition requires the following details:
# - ipaddress: IP of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller
# - username: the name of the administrative user on the CIMC
# - password: the password of the administrative user on the CIMC
# - system-hostname: the hostname MAAS will give to the node upon
#                    install.  The domain will be appended to this
#                    hostname part automatically.
# - system-macaddresses: A MAC address on the elisted machine. This mac address
#     can be any MAC on the machine. It is used by MAAS to identify the machine
#     that is PXE booting to name that machine per the defined system-hostname.
#
# NOTE: Any machines intended for this openstack cloud will have corresponding
# entries the openstack-services section.


# Example
ipmi-machines:
    - {ipaddress: 10.64.72.25, username: admin, password: Sdu12345,
           system-macaddresses: ['74:a2:e6:a3:45:8c'],
           system-hostname: comp0}
    - {ipaddress: 10.64.72.27, username: admin, password: Sdu12345,
           system-macaddresses: ['74:a2:e6:a3:4d:4e'],
           system-hostname: comp1}
    - {ipaddress: 10.64.72.28, username: admin, password: Sdu12345,
           system-macaddresses: ['74:a2:e6:a3:06:26'],
           system-hostname: comp2}

# ----------------------------------
# Network definitions
# ----------------------------------
networks:
    # The PXE network on which the MAAS server (PXE server) will
    # boot and commission all machines. Each machine will need to
    # have one NIC connected to the PXE network. The BIOS on each
    # machine must set the NIC to PXE boot as the primary boot
    # option. free-ip-low/high is the range of addresses that MAAS
    # will divide up for use by DHCP. Make sure this is truly free
    # on the network (for instance, doesn't include the gateway or
    # the MAAS server).
    - {name: pxe, cidr: 10.20.0.0/24, gateway: 10.20.0.1,
       dns: 72.163.128.140,
       free-ip-low: 10.20.0.11, free-ip-high: 10.20.0.250}

    # Provider network definitions are optional when the cloud network topology
    # is openvswitch. The network definitions and associated
    # macaddresses are stored in MAAS as a unmanaged networks.
    # The provider network parameters are passed as 
    # mac-network-map configuration options to the VPP charm when deploying
    # cisco-opendaylight. When deploying openvswitch, those mac addresses are
    # provided to bridge mappings and can define either flat or vlan network
    # types.
    #
    # The provider network definitions can be omitted for openvswitch
    # deployments but may be used for testing purposes.
    #
    # MAC addresses can be repeated in multiple provider networks as long
    # as the network name and optional vlan range is different.
    # 
    # Each provider network defines the following fields:
    # - name: An alpha-numeric label for this network
    # - macaddresses: A list of MACs associated with this network. These MAC
    #     addresses must match a discovered MAC address of one of the target
    #     nodes in the deployment that MAAS has enlisted.
    # - type: The network type, can be vlan or flat.
    # - range: Optionally for vlan type networks, a unique range of vlan ids.
    #     For example, range: '100:200' would associate vlan ids 100 to 200
    #     with the bridge created.
    # - bond-name: Set this to the bond you want to create on each
    #              machine.  If unspecified, the interfaces will not
    #              be bonded.
    # - other "bond-" parameters are optional, they are listed in
    #   the provider1 example, along with their defaults.

    - {name: provider1,
       type: vlan, range: '1:2000',
       macaddresses: ['a8:9d:21:28:54:9b',
                      'a8:9d:21:28:4a:a7',
                      'a8:9d:21:28:4c:fd']}

    - {name: provider2, type: flat,
       macaddresses: ['74:a2:e6:a3:45:8d',
                      '74:a2:e6:a3:4d:4f',
